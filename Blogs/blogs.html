                <h3><strong>What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</strong> </h3>
                <h4>What is DOM?</h4> <hr>
                <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. We can change the document structure, style, and content. Besides we can add or update new content.
                The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. In DOM structure HTML file behaves like the document, and all the html tags behaves like object. We can access html tags like the javascript object in DOM.</p>

                <h4>What is the purpose of DOM?</h4>

                    <li>Maintain a standard programming interface for HTML and XML documents.</li>
                    <li>Adding, removing or modifying the HTML elements themselves.</li>
                    <li>Modifying any attribute of an HTML element, such as their class, style attributes and others</li>
                    <li>We can even use JavaScript to add animation to a document.</li>

                <h3><strong>How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</strong> </h3>
                <h4>How will you select HTML elements using DOM?</h4> <hr>
                <p>We can select an element based on its unique ID with the <strong>getElementById()</strong> method. This is the easiest way to find an HTML element in the DOM tree. Similarly, we can use the <strong>getElementsByClassName()</strong> method to select all the elements having specific class names. This method returns an array-like object of all child elements which have all of the given class names. We can also select HTML elements by tag name using the <strong>getElementsByTagName()</strong> method. This method also returns an array-like object of all child elements with the given tag name. We can use the <strong>querySelectorAll()</strong> method to select elements that matches the specified CSS selector. CSS selectors provide a very powerful and efficient way of selecting HTML elements in a document.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>
                    Actually event bubble means propagate an aevent from the lowest to the highest. It's a concept of DOM. It happens when an element receves an event. And that event bubbles up or tranamitted or propagate to it's parent and ancestor elements (grand parent) in the DOM tree untill it gets the root element.

                <h3><strong>What is a callback function and why will you use it? </strong> </h3> 
                <h4>What is a callback function</h4><hr>
                <p>Any function that is pased as an argument to another function so that it can be exicuted in that other function is called as a callback function. This execution may be immediate as in a synchronous callback, or it might happen at a later point in time as in an asynchronous callback</p>

                <h4>Why will we use callback function? </h4> <hr>
                <p>JavaScript runs code sequentially in top-down order. However, there are some cases that code runs (or must run) after something else happens and also not sequentially. This is called asynchronous programming. Callbacks make sure that a function is not going to run before a task is completed but will run right after the task has completed. It helps us develop asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps us safe from problems and errors.</p>
